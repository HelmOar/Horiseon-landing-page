# <Horiseon-landing-page

## Description

To modify Horseon's landing page to create a more accessible UI, in accordance with the specific criteria provided for this project. It was observed that the original HTML coding did not follow semantic conventions or accessibilty protocols and these were modified. CSS selectors and properties were also consolidated and organised to follow the new semantic structure. 


## Usage

To provide users with a more accessible experience and to increase webpage SEO. Improved accessibility of the page will also avoid any future discrimination litigation.
